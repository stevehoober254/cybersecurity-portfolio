# Enterprise SOC Simulator

A self-contained Security Operations Center (SOC) simulation environment for practicing incident detection and response using real-world tools.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Many security analysts lack access to realistic labs. This project simulates a full SOC stack to:
- Analyze network + host activity
- Simulate insider and external attacks
- Investigate logs with Kibana
- Detect attacks using Sigma rules and MITRE ATT&CK mappings
